# Building Name Resolution Investigation

## Problem Statement

Currently, SCMD_BuildStructure commands show generic faction-based names (e.g., "AfrikaKorps Building") instead of actual building names from localization files (e.g., "Infanterie Kompanie").

## Objective

Map SCMD command indices to actual building PBGIDs to display localized building names.

## Known Information

From previous debugging:
- SCMD_BuildStructure commands contain an `index` field instead of direct `pbgid`
- Example indices found: 45, 61, 182
- Expected building: Wehrmacht "11153659": "Infanterie Kompanie"
- Localization file: `data/coh3-data/locales/en-locstring.json`

## Investigation Log

### Investigation 1: Data Structure Analysis
**Date**: 2025-01-07
**Investigator**: Claude Code

#### COH3 Data Structure Analysis

**EBPS (Entity Blueprints) Structure:**
- Located at: `data/coh3-data/ebps.json`
- Structure: `races[faction_name][category][building_key]`
- Factions: `afrika_korps`, `american`, `british`, `british_africa`, `common`, `german`
- Building categories: `buildings.production`, `buildings.defensive`, `buildings.sp`
- Each building has: `pbgid`, `parent_pbg`, `extensions`, `custom_properties`

**Building Name Resolution:**
- Building names are stored in localization files: `data/coh3-data/locales/en-locstring.json`
- Names are referenced through UI extensions in building data
- Pattern: `extensions[].exts.screen_name.locstring.value` -> localization ID
- Example: Building ID 198236 -> UI extension -> locstring "11182053" -> "Light Support Kompanie"

**SCMD Command Structure:**
- `SCMD_BuildStructure` commands contain an `index` field instead of direct `pbgid`
- This `index` appears to be a reference to a command table or build order
- Current parsing extracts `pbgid` but `SCMD_BuildStructure` uses `index: 182` format
- Need to map: `index` -> `pbgid` -> localized building name

#### Key Findings

1. **Building Data Successfully Mapped**: Found 183 buildings with proper localized names
2. **Index-PBGID Gap**: SCMD commands use `index` field, not direct `pbgid`
3. **Current Fallback**: System falls back to faction-based names ("AfrikaKorps Building")
4. **Missing Mapping Table**: No direct mapping between SCMD indices and building PBGIDs found

#### Sample Building Mappings Found

**Afrika Korps Buildings:**
- PBGID 198235: "Headquarters" (afrika_korps, production, hq_ak)
- PBGID 198236: "Light Support Kompanie" (afrika_korps, production, infanterie_support_ak)
- PBGID 198237: "Mechanized Kompanie" (afrika_korps, production, mechanized_kompanie_ak)
- PBGID 198240: "Panzerarmee Kommand" (afrika_korps, production, panzer_kompanie_ak)
- PBGID 198242: "Heavy Weapon Kompanie" (afrika_korps, production, heavy_weapon_kompanie_ak)

**American Buildings:**
- PBGID 164768: "Headquarters" (american, production, hq_us)
- PBGID 169963: "Barracks" (american, production, barracks_us)
- PBGID 169964: "Weapon Support Center" (american, production, weapon_support_center_us)
- PBGID 169965: "Motor Pool" (american, production, motor_pool_us)
- PBGID 169966: "Tank Depot" (american, production, tank_depot_us)

**Wehrmacht Buildings:**
- PBGID 170265: "Headquarters" (german, production, hq_ger)
- PBGID 170266: "Infanterie Kompanie" (german, production, infanterie_kompanie_ger)
- PBGID 170267: "Panzergrenadier Kompanie" (german, production, support_armory_ger)
- PBGID 170268: "Luftwaffe Kompanie" (german, production, mechanized_kompanie_ger)
- PBGID 170269: "Panzer Kompanie" (german, production, panzer_armory_ger)

#### Technical Implementation Issues

1. **Command Parsing**: Current `extract_pbgid()` function looks for `pbgid:` patterns but SCMD commands use `index:` patterns
2. **Missing Index Extraction**: Need to extract `index` field from `SCMD_BuildStructure` commands
3. **Index-PBGID Mapping**: No mapping table found between command indices and building PBGIDs
4. **Fallback Logic**: Currently falls back to generic faction names when PBGID resolution fails

#### Next Steps Required

1. **Extract Index Field**: Modify Rust code to extract `index` from SCMD commands
2. **Build Index-PBGID Map**: Research how game maps command indices to building PBGIDs
3. **Enhanced Lookup**: Update Go lookup logic to handle index-based commands
4. **Test With More Replays**: Verify index patterns across different replays and factions

#### Code Locations

- **Rust Command Parsing**: `/vault-wrapper/src/lib.rs` lines 555-569 (`extract_pbgid`)
- **Go Enhancement Logic**: `/vault/vault.go` lines 265-302 (`enhanceCommandsWithPlayerInfo`)
- **Building Data**: `/data/coh3-data/ebps.json` (183 buildings mapped)
- **Localization**: `/data/coh3-data/locales/en-locstring.json`

### Investigation 2: SCMD Index Analysis
**Date**: 2025-01-07
**Investigator**: Claude Code

#### Examining Known SCMD Command

From our test replay, we know:
- Player: Surgie (Americans)
- Command: SCMD_BuildStructure
- Timestamp: ~12:31 (750-752 seconds)
- Index: 182
- Expected result: Should show actual building name, not "Americans Building"

#### Command Structure Analysis

**Exact SCMD_BuildStructure Structure:**
```
Unknown {
    tick: 6010,
    index: 182,
    action_type: SCMD_BuildStructure,
}
```

**Key Observations:**
1. **No PBGID field**: SCMD commands use `index` instead of `pbgid`
2. **Runtime Entity Reference**: Index 182 appears to be a runtime entity identifier
3. **Current Parser Limitation**: Our `extract_pbgid()` function only looks for `pbgid:` patterns

#### Critical Discovery: Index vs PBGID System

**Index Field Analysis:**
- Index 182 appears in multiple command types throughout the replay
- Same index used for different operations on the same entity
- At tick 8207: BuildSquad command shows `index: 182` with `pbgid: 203611`
- PBGID 203611 is a squad (sbps), not a building (ebps)

**Conclusion**: The `index` field is a runtime entity identifier that gets assigned when entities are created during the match. SCMD_BuildStructure commands reference buildings by their runtime index, not their blueprint PBGID.

#### Root Cause Identified

**Current Parsing Logic Failure:**
```rust
// Current function only looks for pbgid patterns
fn extract_pbgid(command_debug: &str) -> Option<String> {
    if let Some(start) = command_debug.find("pbgid:") { ... }
    if let Some(start) = command_debug.find("Pbgid(") { ... }
    None  // SCMD commands fail here
}
```

**What We Need:**
1. Extract `index` field from SCMD commands
2. Map runtime index numbers to actual building PBGIDs
3. Track entity creation throughout the replay to build index-to-PBGID mapping

### Investigation 3: Solution Architecture
**Date**: 2025-01-07
**Investigator**: Claude Code

#### Required Implementation Changes

**1. Modify Command Structure:**
```rust
pub struct Command {
    pub timestamp: u32,
    pub command_type: String,
    pub details: String,
    pub pbgid: Option<String>,         // Existing field
    pub index: Option<String>,         // NEW: For SCMD commands
    pub unit_name: Option<String>,
    pub building_name: Option<String>,
}
```

**2. Add Index Extraction:**
```rust
fn extract_index(command_debug: &str) -> Option<String> {
    if let Some(start) = command_debug.find("index: ") {
        let substring = &command_debug[start + 7..];
        if let Some(end) = substring.find(',').or_else(|| substring.find('}')) {
            return Some(substring[..end].trim().to_string());
        }
    }
    None
}
```

**3. Entity Tracking System:**
- Build index-to-PBGID mapping during replay parsing
- Track entity creation events to understand what index 182 represents
- Correlate SCMD_BuildStructure timing with actual building creation

#### Complexity Assessment

**High Complexity Issue**: This requires understanding the game's entity management system, not just static data lookups. The challenge is that we need to:
1. Parse the entire replay to track entity creation
2. Build dynamic mapping tables during parsing
3. Handle the timing relationship between commands and entity creation

**Alternative Approaches:**
1. **Static Index Mapping**: Research if there's a fixed mapping table in the game files
2. **Pattern Analysis**: Analyze multiple replays to find index patterns
3. **Entity Lifecycle Tracking**: Full implementation of entity state tracking

### Investigation 4: Index-PBGID Pattern Discovery
**Date**: 2025-01-07
**Investigator**: Claude Code

#### Breakthrough: Entity Creation Pattern Found

**Key Discovery**: BuildSquad commands show the index-to-PBGID relationship:

```
BuildSquad(
    SourcedPbgid {
        tick: 8207,
        index: 182,
        pbgid: 203611,
        source_identifier: 64530,
    }
)
```

**Analysis of Index 182:**
- First used at tick 1888: `SCMD_Move` with index 182
- Multiple `SCMD_Move` commands throughout the replay with index 182
- At tick 6010: `SCMD_BuildStructure` with index 182
- At tick 8207: `BuildSquad` shows index 182 maps to PBGID 203611

**Entity Lifecycle Understanding:**
1. **Entity Creation**: At some point, entity with index 182 is created
2. **Movement Commands**: Multiple SCMD_Move commands operate on index 182
3. **Build Command**: SCMD_BuildStructure references index 182 
4. **Squad Production**: BuildSquad command shows index 182 produces PBGID 203611

#### Critical Insight: Building vs Squad Relationship

**The Problem**: PBGID 203611 is a squad, not a building. This suggests:
1. Index 182 refers to a building entity
2. The building (index 182) produces squads (PBGID 203611)
3. SCMD_BuildStructure creates the building entity
4. Later BuildSquad commands use the building to produce units

**What We're Missing**: The actual building PBGID that index 182 represents.

#### Other Construction Patterns Found

**PCMD_PlaceAndConstructEntities Examples:**
- Tick 790: index 22
- Tick 1012: index 57  
- Tick 1556: index 95

These suggest a sequential index assignment system where each new entity gets the next available index number.

#### Solution Strategy Refined

**Immediate Implementation Option:**
1. Extract `index` field from SCMD_BuildStructure commands
2. For now, fall back to meaningful names like "Americans Building (Structure #182)"
3. Build entity tracking system incrementally to resolve actual building types

**Medium-term Solution:**
- Track entity creation events to map indices to building PBGIDs
- Correlate construction timing with entity spawning
- Build a complete entity lifecycle tracking system

#### Next Action Items

**Priority 1 - Quick Fix:**
1. Modify `extract_pbgid()` to also extract `index` field
2. Update Command struct to include index field
3. Show "Building #182" instead of generic "Americans Building"

**Priority 2 - Full Solution:**
1. Implement entity tracking across entire replay
2. Map entity indices to their blueprint PBGIDs
3. Resolve actual building names from the mapping system

## Investigation Summary and Recommendations

### Root Cause Analysis
The building name resolution issue stems from a fundamental difference in command structure:
- **PCMD commands**: Use direct `pbgid` fields that can be looked up in static data files
- **SCMD commands**: Use runtime `index` fields that reference entities created during the match

### Current Status
- ✅ **Problem Identified**: SCMD_BuildStructure uses index-based entity references
- ✅ **Data Structure Mapped**: 183 buildings with proper localized names available
- ✅ **Pattern Discovered**: Index lifecycle shows entity creation and usage
- ❌ **Missing Link**: Direct mapping from SCMD index to building PBGID

### Immediate Implementation (Low Effort, Medium Value)
**Goal**: Show meaningful building information instead of generic faction names

**Changes Required:**
1. Add `index` field to Command struct
2. Extract index from SCMD commands  
3. Display "Building #182" or "Americans Building (Structure #182)"

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Value**: Users see specific building references instead of generic names

### Complete Solution (High Effort, High Value)
**Goal**: Show actual building names like "Infanterie Kompanie"

**Approach**: Entity lifecycle tracking system that:
1. Tracks all entity creation events during replay parsing
2. Maps entity indices to their blueprint PBGIDs when they're created
3. Resolves SCMD commands to actual building names

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days
**Value**: Complete building name resolution as originally requested

### Alternative Approaches for Future Investigation
1. **Game File Analysis**: Research additional COH3 data files for index mapping tables
2. **Multiple Replay Analysis**: Pattern matching across different replays and factions
3. **Community Resources**: Leverage existing COH3 modding/analysis tools

### Files Modified for Immediate Fix
- `/vault-wrapper/src/lib.rs`: Add index extraction
- `/vault/vault.go`: Update Command struct and enhance logic  
- Tests: Update expectations for index-based building references

### Conclusion
The investigation successfully identified the core issue and provides both immediate and long-term solution paths. The immediate fix provides significant value with minimal effort, while the complete solution requires a more sophisticated entity tracking system but delivers the full functionality requested.
